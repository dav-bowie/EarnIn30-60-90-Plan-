## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option A: Netlify Deployment (Recommended)

#### Quick Deploy (Drag & Drop)
1. Zip your entire `EarnIn` folder
2. Go to [netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com/drop)
3. Drag and drop your zip file
4. Netlify will auto-deploy your site
5. Share the URL with EarnIn team

#### Git-Based Deploy
```bash
# If you have a GitHub repo
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial portfolio deployment"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main

# Then connect to Netlify
# Netlify will auto-deploy on every push
```

#### Manual Deploy with Netlify CLI
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
netlify deploy --prod --dir .
```

### Option B: GitHub Pages Deployment

1. Create a GitHub repository
2. Push your code
3. Go to Settings > Pages
4. Select main branch as source
5. GitHub will generate your site URL

**Note:** GitHub Pages has limitations:
- No server-side storage
- Videos must be small (< 100MB total recommended)
- localStorage only works per user

### Option C: Simple Web Server

If you have Python installed:
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000
```

Or use the included `launch_server.py`:
```bash
python launch_server.py
# Follow instructions in browser
```

## 🔗 Key URLs After Deployment

Once deployed, you'll have:
- **Home Page:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/index.html`
- **30-60-90 Plan:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/index.html`
- **AI Portfolio:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/netlify-portfolio.html`
- **Video Gallery:** `https://your-site.netlify.app/viewer-portfolio.html`

## 📝 What to Share with EarnIn

Send them:
1. ✅ **Deployed URL** (e.g., `https://your-name.netlify.app`)
2. ✅ **Brief explanation** of what you built
3. ✅ **Note about upload process** (they upload videos through browser)
4. ✅ **Key features** you want to highlight

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Video Storage Limitation
- Currently videos are stored in browser localStorage
- Each person viewing will need to upload videos themselves
- For permanent storage, implement backend storage (see Option 2 in `VIDEO_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`)

### Recommended Share Process
1. Deploy the site
2. Upload videos to YOUR browser
3. Take screenshots or record a demo
4. Share both the live site URL and demo video
5. Explain they can upload their own videos when viewing

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Videos won't show after deployment
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Clear browser cache
- Re-upload videos through the interface

### Site shows blank page
- Check all file paths are relative (not absolute)
- Ensure all files are in the root directory
- Check browser console for missing resources

### Videos don't persist
- localStorage is browser-specific
- User must upload videos in their own browser
- This is expected behavior for the current setup

## 📞 Support

If you encounter issues:
1. Check browser console (F12 > Console tab)
2. Review `VIDEO_UPLOAD_GUIDE.md`
3. Check `README.md` for general info
4. Verify all required files are present

## ✨ Next Steps After Deployment

1. ✅ Share URL with EarnIn team
2. ✅ Prepare demo walkthrough
3. ✅ Highlight key features in your pitch
4. ✅ Be ready to discuss the 30-60-90 plan
5. ✅ Emphasize the Predictive Performance Intelligence System
